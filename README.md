# Centroidal_MPC
This repo is the course project of reproducing the result from a recent paper of IIT: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10858392

The paper includes centroidal momentum in the COM dynamic model when formulating the MPC to generate feasible
COM trajectory. Along with the MPC, an adaptive control term is introduced to handle external force
disturbances and ensure the Lyapunov stabilily of the centroidal dynamics
